# Home-Loan-Prediction

Project Overview:
In this endeavor, I harnessed the power of data-driven automation to revolutionize the loan eligibility process for Dream Housing Finance. Leveraging a dataset comprising 614 rows and 13 features, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis journey to identify eligible customer segments effectively.

Analytical Approach:
The project's foundation was laid with meticulous Univariate and Bivariate analyses, complemented by frequency and density plots. This phase unearthed vital insights, including the identification of 4 highly correlated features via heatmap analysis. With this groundwork, I embarked on data preprocessing, strategically addressing 4.6% of null values.

Transformation and Model Enhancement:
Taking a transformative approach, I introduced log transformation to newly generated features, resulting in a notable 16% enhancement in model accuracy. The culmination of this meticulous process was the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, yielding an impressive 77.8% accuracy rate. Through a rigorous feature selection process, I identified Credit History and Balance Income as impactful predictors, significantly influencing the model's predictive power.

Significance and Implications:
This project stands as a testament to the potency of data analysis and machine learning in reshaping operational paradigms. By automating the loan eligibility process, I enabled Dream Housing Finance to target eligible segments more precisely. The implementation of advanced analytical techniques, coupled with strategic transformations, showcases the project's capacity to enhance predictive accuracy and uncover pivotal insights.

Conclusion:
Incorporating data-driven automation and sophisticated analytical techniques, this project underscores the potential of machine learning to drive operational efficiency and informed decision-making. The model's accuracy gains and the identification of impactful features emphasize the value it brings to the realm of loan eligibility assessment.
